### Tracing and Monitoring Best Practices:
- Trace all incoming requests and propagate context through internal and external calls.
- Use middleware to instrument HTTP and gRPC endpoints automatically.
- Annotate slow, critical, or error-prone paths with custom spans.
- Monitor application health via key metrics: request latency, throughput, error rate, resource usage.
- Define SLIs (e.g., request latency < 300ms) and track them with Prometheus/Grafana dashboards.
- Alert on key conditions (e.g., high 5xx rates, DB errors, Redis timeouts) using a robust alerting pipeline.
- Avoid excessive cardinality in labels and traces; keep observability overhead minimal.
- Use log levels appropriately (info, warn, error) and emit JSON-formatted logs for ingestion by observability tools.
- Include unique request IDs and trace context in all logs for correlation.

### Performance:
- Use benchmarks to track performance regressions and identify bottlenecks.
- Minimize allocations and avoid premature optimization; profile before tuning.
- Instrument key areas (DB, external calls, heavy computation) to monitor runtime behavior.

### Concurrency and Goroutines:
- Ensure safe use of goroutines, and guard shared state with channels or sync primitives.
- Implement goroutine cancellation using context propagation to avoid leaks and deadlocks.

### Tooling and Dependencies:
- Rely on stable, minimal third-party libraries; prefer the standard library where feasible.
- Use Go modules for dependency management and reproducibility.
- Version-lock dependencies for deterministic builds.
- Integrate linting, testing, and security checks in CI pipelines.

### Key Conventions:
1. Prioritize readability, simplicity, and maintainability.
2. Design for change: isolate business logic and minimize framework lock-in.
3. Emphasize clear boundaries and dependency inversion.
4. Ensure all behavior is observable, testable, and documented.
5. Automate workflows for testing, building, and deployment.
